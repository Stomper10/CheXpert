# CheXpert: A Large Chest X-Ray Dataset and Competitions
> CheXpert is a large dataset of chest X-rays and competition for automated chest X-ray interpretation, which features uncertainty labels and radiologist-labeled reference standard evaluation sets. *- from the CheXpert [webpage](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/) description*

This repository aims to reproduce and improve CheXpert [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07031.pdf)'s results using the PyTorch library.
For the baseline, I tried to use the same model(DenseNet121) and the same parameters as the paper.

Since I know my results are still far short of the paper's, I will do many experiments from now on. If you have any ideas or suggestions to improve the model, please let me know!

This repository especially referenced [here](https://github.com/gaetandi/cheXpert) for the coding part. You can easily run the code with the following instructions.

This code is written for the GPU environment. It could be hard to run in CPU environment.



# 0. Environment
For those who want to compare the running environment, mine was as below(used GPU server).
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch 1.7.1
- Intel Xeon Silver 4216 CPU
- 512GB memory
- Four Nvidia Titan RTX GPUs

First, use `git clone` command to download this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stomper10/CheXpert.git
```


# 1. Download the Data
At the bottom of the CheXpert [webpage](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/), write a registration form to download the CheXpert dataset.
You will receive an email with the download link. Right-click your mouse on the download link(439GB or 11GB) and click 'Copy link address'.

Then, run the following command. Paste your link address inside the double quotation marks(PLEASE RUN WITH QUOTATION MARKS). It will take a while even for the downsampled(11GB) dataset.

```bash
wget "link_address_you_copied"
```

After you downloaded the dataset, run the following command to unzip the `.zip` file.

```bash
unzip CheXpert-v1.0-small.zip
unzip CheXpert-v1.0.zip
```

Now the data is ready. As you see this repository structure, you have to place the `CheXpert-v1.0-small`, and `CheXpert-v1.0` directories with the rest of the files(`.py` and `.ipynb`) at the same location unless you modify the path in the source code.



# 2. Run the CheXpert
## Set Configurations
You can set hyperparameters in the `configuration.json` file such as maximum training epoch, type of image, batch size, etc.
Here are some descriptions of hyperparameters.

Name | Example | Description
:-: | :-: | :-:
image_type | "small" | The image type of data. <br /> For the original image (439GB), set as `""`.
pre_trained | false | Whether the model is pre-trained.
nnClassCount | 5 | The number of training observations. <br /> Example is set to 5 competition observations. If you want all, set as `14`.
batch_size | 16 | The number of batch size.
epochs | 3 | The number of training epochs.
imgtransResize | 320 | Resizing image in transformation.
train_ratio | 1 | Training data ratio.
lr | 0.0001 | Learning rate of optimizer.
betas | [0.9, 0.999] | Betas of optimizer.
eps | 1e-08 | Eps of optimizer.
weight_decay | 0 | Weight decay of optimizer.

## Data Preprocessing
You **MUST** run the following command before running the model. Running the `run_preprocessing.py` file makes the test set ready. Since the CheXpert uses a hidden test set for the official evaluation of models, I made the given validation set as the test set to repeat experiments. Then, I made the validation set extracted from the training set.

```bash
python3 run_preprocessing.py configuration.json
```

## Run the Model
Now you can run the model like below. You can use some options to run the model.
```bash
python3 run_chexpert.py configuration.json
```

Options | Shortcut | Description | Default
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
--output_path| -o | Path to save results. | results/
--random_seed | -s | Random seed for reproduction. | 0

I also recommend you to use the `nohup` command if you run this code on server since it takes several hours.
```bash
nohup python3 run_chexpert.py configuration.json > progress.txt &
```



# 3. Results
You may get training and validation losses, as well as the test accuracy and ROC curves. You can also check the computational costs. Models(`*.pth.tar`), test set probabilities(`testPROB_frt.txt`, `testPROB_lat.txt`, `testPROB_all.txt`), and ROC curve(`ROC_*.png`) files will be saved in the `results` directory. In addition, the best models for each competition observation is also saved. If you run the code with `nohup` command, you can also save whole printed outputs. Let me just show you the ROC curves here.

![ROC_5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43818471/108703317-cc923e80-754d-11eb-928a-f624d445b3de.png)

The following table shows a comparison with the original paper results. I know it's not an accurate comparison since the test set is different. But at least we can roughly gauge the model's performance.

* Stanford Baseline(ensemble) AUC = 0.907
* My Baseline AUC(small) = 0.852
* My Baseline AUC(original) = 0.864

Observation | Experiment AUC | Paper AUC | Difference
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-:
Atelectasis | 0.80 | 0.85 | -0.05
Cardiomegaly | 0.80 | 0.90 | -0.10
Consolidation | 0.90 | 0.90 | -0.00
Edema | 0.90 | 0.92 | -0.02
Pleural Effusion | 0.92 | 0.97 | -0.05
**Mean of 5 obs.** | **0.86** | **0.91** | **-0.05**



## This Part is Optional
### Deep Ensembles
You can try deep ensembles with `run_ensembles.py` file.
Under the `ensembles` directory, place **ONLY** experiment output directories you want to aggregate. If you place other directories, it will throw an error.
When running the `run_chexpert.py`, set `--output_path` under the ensembles directory.
`run_ensembles.py` have `--output_path` option just like `run_chexpert.py`. The ensemble results will be saved in `--output_path` you set.
```bash
python3 run_chexpert.py configuration.json --output_path=emsembles/experiment_01/ --random_seed=1
python3 run_chexpert.py configuration.json --output_path=emsembles/experiment_02/ --random_seed=2
python3 run_chexpert.py configuration.json --output_path=emsembles/experiment_03/ --random_seed=3

python3 run_ensembles.py configuration.json --output_path=results/ensem_results/
```

### Federated Learning (arranged version will be provided)
You can try federated learning using the `CheXpert_DenseNet121_FL.ipynb` file. You can modify federated learning hyperparameters.

### Grad-CAM (arranged version will be provided)
You can try the Grad-CAM method on test set with `Grad-CAM.ipynb` file after you get the trained model.
